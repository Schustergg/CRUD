# CRUD API

## Overview
The **CRUD API** is a robust, scalable, and modular application designed with best practices in mind. It provides a clean and maintainable architecture following **Clean Code** principles and **SOLID** design patterns. The API is built to handle complex business logic while ensuring high performance and reliability.

This project includes:
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Secured endpoints using authentication and role-based authorization.
- **API Versioning**: Supports versioning to ensure backward compatibility.
- **Distributed Caching**: Implements Redis for distributed caching to improve performance.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling to provide a robust and fault-tolerant system.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed with a modular and scalable architecture to support future growth.

## Features
1. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Secured endpoints using `Authorize` attributes.
   - Protects resources and ensures only authenticated users can access them.

2. **API Versioning**:
   - Supports versioning through URL paths (e.g., `api/v1/products`).

3. **Distributed Caching**:
   - Uses Redis to cache frequently accessed data, reducing database load and improving response times.

4. **Clean Code and SOLID Principles**:
   - Follows best practices for maintainable and readable code.
   - Implements **Dependency Injection** and **Separation of Concerns**.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Provides meaningful error responses.
   - Validates input and handles exceptions gracefully.

6. **Scalable and Modular Architecture**:
   - Built with a layered architecture to separate concerns.
   - Easily extendable for new features or modules.
